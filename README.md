# socket.io-map
A simple experiment updating the position of markers (cars) on a leaflet map through the use of websockets.
When a user on another device drags a marker around on the map, this will update the position of that marker on all other connected clients' maps

Quick Start

$ git clone https://github.com/brambo48/socket.io-map.git
